- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor CPU usage
- [ ] Monitor memory usage
- [ ] Monitor disk space
- [ ] Monitor network traffic
- [ ] Set up alerts for resource thresholds
- [ ] Monitor database performance

### Security Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor failed login attempts
- [ ] Track suspicious activities
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection
- [ ] Monitor for SQL injection attempts
- [ ] Track API abuse
- [ ] Monitor for DDoS attacks

## ðŸ”„ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Review and rotate secrets quarterly
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Review security logs weekly
- [ ] Check backup integrity weekly
- [ ] Test disaster recovery monthly
- [ ] Review access logs monthly

### Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Document deployment process
- [ ] Document rollback procedure
- [ ] Create runbook for common issues

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Pre-production Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] End-to-end tests pass
- [ ] Security tests pass
- [ ] Performance tests pass
- [ ] Load tests pass

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Login with valid credentials
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials

- [ ] Create user (admin)
- [ ] Edit user (admin)
- [ ] Delete user (admin)
- [ ] Access user management as non-admin (should fail)
- [ ] Activate/deactivate user
- [ ] Access protected routes without token (should fail)

## ðŸ“‹ Compliance
